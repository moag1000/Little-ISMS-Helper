## Common Questions

**Q: Can a CTPP refuse designation?**
A: No. Designation is mandatory if criteria met. CTPP can object during 6-week period, but ESAs have final decision.

**Q: What are the costs for CTPPs?**
A: Compliance costs: €500k-€5M/year depending on size. Includes: liaison team, reporting systems, inspection facilitation, remediation.

**Q: Do CTPPs pay oversight fees?**
A: Yes. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2024/1505 specifies fee structure (separate document).

**Q: Can designation be removed?**
A: Yes, via annual review if CTPP no longer meets criteria (e.g., reduced financial entity base, market share decline).

**Q: What happens if CTPP doesn't comply?**
A: Escalating measures: Recommendations → Penalties (€5M or 1% turnover) → Periodic payments (€50k/day) → Potential service restrictions.

**Q: Can financial entities still use non-compliant CTPPs?**
A: Financial entities bear responsibility. Using non-compliant CTPP = financial entity non-compliance with DORA Article 28-30.
