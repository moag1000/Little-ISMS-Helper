  description:
    transitive: Analyzes how requirements of different frameworks overlap and create leverage effects.
    compare: Compares two compliance frameworks for overlaps and differences.
    gap_analysis: Identifies gaps in the implementation of a framework and prioritizes remediation actions.
    data_reuse: Analyzes reuse of data points across frameworks and highlights efficiency potential.
    critical_gaps: Critical gaps with highest priority for immediate action.
    high_gaps: Severe gaps with high priority.
    medium_gaps: Medium gaps with moderate priority.
    low_gaps: Low gaps to be addressed later.
    reuse_matrix: Overview of where data can be reused across frameworks.
